# 🧠 Python Algorithms Journey

This repository is part of my **learning journey in Python** — where I’m practicing and understanding different **algorithms** step by step.  

I’m starting with the basics and will keep adding new ones as I learn more!

---

## 🎯 Goal

To build a strong foundation in:
- Python programming  
- Problem-solving  
- Data structures and algorithms  

---

## 📁 Project Setup

To clone and open the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-algorithms-journey.git
cd python-algorithms-journey
```


## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- Writing simple Python functions  
- Understanding how algorithms work step-by-step  
- Learning to analyze and improve code efficiency  
- Preparing for more advanced concepts like:
  - Recursion  
  - Dynamic programming  
  - Graph algorithms  



## 🌱 Next Steps

- Add more beginner algorithms  
- Add explanations in comments  
- Learn how to measure algorithm performance (Big O)  
- Organize files into folders later  


## 🌟 Contributing

This is a personal learning project — but if you’re also learning, feel free to:

- Suggest easier explanations  
- Share beginner-friendly ideas  
- Open small issues for discussion
